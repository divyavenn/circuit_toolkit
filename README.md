# The Lazy Engineer's Circuit Toolkit

This is a collection of matlab scrips and python scripts that'll help you breeze through any circuit analysis problem.

circuit_analyzer.py allows you to enter in all common circuit elements and it will output the circuit breakdown in the console - printing the current, voltage, and power across every single element.

The correctness of these scripts has been validates across a semester's worth of circuit problems, from simple to advanced.
You can add any number of current and voltage sources, in any number of mesh configurations, using a simple array input.
